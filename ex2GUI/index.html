<title>Example 2: Perfusion Analysis using pcASL (GUI)</title>
</head>

<body>
<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Example 2: Perfusion Analysis using pcASL (GUI)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this example is essentailly do a better job of the
  analysis we did in  <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> on the same data using the <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BASIL"
  target="dynamic">BASIL</a> GUI in FSL. Thus this example
  incorporates various corrections, for motion and distortion, as
  outlined in Chapter 2 of the primer. The example then goes on to
  explore calibration (Chapter 5) and partial volume correction (Chapter
  6). There is a similar example
  using the command line tools <a href="../ex2/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <p> NOTE that we reccomend you use FSL v6.0.1 (or higher) for these exercises.</p>

  <p> For this example you should use the Single PLD pcASL dataset
  set. This ASL data was acquired using pcASL labelling
  with a label duration of 1.8 seconds and a post-labelling delay
  (PLD) of 1.8 seconds, following the recommendations of the ASL
  consensus paper. </p>

</pre>

  <h2>Perfusion Quantification</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Boxes 1.3, 3.1, 3.2 & 5.1)</h3>

<p>We can improve upon the analysis we did in <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a>. First, follow the steps to setup the
  analysis as for that analysis, but before you hit 'Run' make the
  following modifications.</p>

  <p>On the 'Distortion Correction' tab, select 'Apply distortion
  correction'. Load the 'Phase-encode-reveresed calibration image'
  <code>aslcalib_PA.nii.gz</code>. Set the 'Effective EPI echo
  spacing' to 0.95ms and the 'Phase encoding direction' to 'y'.</p>

   <img src="Dist.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI previewing perfusion-weighted
  image" width=900>

  <p>On the 'Analysis' tab, select 'Motion Correction'. Make sure you
  have 'Adaptive spatial regularisation on perfusion' selected (it is
by default). This will reduce the appearance of noise in the final
  perfusion image using the
  minimum ammount of smoothing appropriate for the data. Now click 'Run'.</p>

 <img src="Analysis2.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Analysis" width=900>
  
<p>For this analysis we are still in 'White
Paper' mode.Specifically this means we are using
  simplest kinetic model that assumes all delivered blood-water has
  the same T1 as that of blood (see Chapter 4 of the ASL primer for
  more information) and that the Arterial Transit Time should be
  treated as 0 seconds.</p>

<p>To view the final result:</p>
<pre class="bash">
fsleyes oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib.nii.gz
  </pre>

<p>The result will be similar to the analysis in <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> although the effect of distortion
  correction should be noticeable in the anterior protion of the
  brain. The effects of motion correction are less obvious, this
  data does not have a lot of motion corruption in it.</p>

  <h2>Making use of Structural Images</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Boxes 3.4 & 6.1)</h3> 
  <p>Thus far all of the analyses have relied purely on the ASL data
  alone. However, often you will have a (higher resolution) structural
  image in the same subject and would like to use this as well, at the
  very least as part of the proceess to transform the perfusion images into some
  template space.</p>

  <p>We can repeat the analysis above but now providing structural
  information. The recommended way to do
  this is to take your T1 weighted structural image (which is most
  common) and firstly process using <code>fsl_anat</code>, passing the
output directly from that tool to BASIL. You either ask the GUI to do this for you, or run <code>fsl_anat</code> on the T1-weighted
image that came with this dataset with this command:</p>

<pre class="bash">
  fsl_anat -i T1.nii.gz
  </pre>

<list>Go back to the analysis you have setup above. On the 'Structure'
tab, for 'Structural data from' either:
<li> Select 'Existing FSL_ANAT output' then load the 'Existing FSL_ANAT directory',
e.g. <code>T1.anat</code>, or</li>
<li> Select 'Run FSL_ANAT on structural image' and load the
'Structural Image' <code>T1.nii.gz</code>.</li>
</list>

   <img src="Struct.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Structure" width=900>

  <p>This analysis will take longer overall, although the extra time
  is taken up doing <code>fsl_anat</code> and registration between ASL and structural
  images. </p>

  <p>You will find some new results in the output
  directory:</p>
  <list>
  <li> <code>oxasl/struct_space</code> - this sub-drectory contains results
  transformed into the same space as the structural image. The
 files in here will match those in the <code>native_space</code>
  subdirectry of the earlier analysis, i.e., containing perfusion
images with and without calibration.</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/asl2struct.mat</code> - this is the
  (linear) transformation between ASL and structural space. It can be
  used along with a transformation between sturcutral and template
  space to transform the ASL data into the template space. It was used
  to create the results in <code>oxasl/struct_space</code>.</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib_gm_mean.txt</code> -
  this contains the result of calculating the perfusion within a gray
  matter mask, these are in ml/100g/min. The mask was derived from the partial volume estimates
  created by <code>fsl_anat</code> and transformed into ASL space
  followed by thresholding at 70%. This is a helpful check on the
  absolute perfusion values found and it is not aytpical too see
  values in the range 30-50 here. There is also a white matter result
(for which a threshold of 90% was used).</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/gm_mask.nii.gz</code> - this is the gray
  matter mask used in the above calculations. There is also the
  associated white matter mask.</li>
  <li> <code>oxasl/native_space/gm_roi.nii.gz</code> - this is another
  mask that represents areas in which there is some grey matter (at
  least 10% from the partial volume estimates). This can be useful for
  visualisation, but mainly when looking at partial volume corrected
  data.</li>
  </list>

  <h2>Reference Tissue Calibration</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Examples Boxes 5.3 & 5.4)</h3>
  <p>Thus far the calibration to get perfsion in units of ml/100g/min
  has been done using a voxelwise division of the realtive perfusion
  image by the (suitably corrected) calibration image - so called
  'voxelwise' calibration. This is in keeping with the recommendations
  of the ASL White Paper for a simple to implement quantitative
  analysis. However, we could also choose to use a reference tissue to
  derive a single value for the equilirbirum mangetization of arterial
  blood and use that in the calibnration process.</p>

  <p>Go back to the analysis you have already setup. We are now going
  to turn off 'White Paper' mode and change some options
  to get a potentially more accurate analysis. To do this return to the 'Analysis' tab
  and deselect the 'Check Compatibility' option. Then change the 
  'Arterial Transit Time' from 0 seconds to 1.3 seconds (the
  default value for pcASL in BASIL based on our experience with pcASL
  labeling plane placement) and the 'T1' value (for tissue) to 1.3s,
  different to 'T1b' (for arterial blood), since the Standard (aka
  Buxton) model for ASL kinetics considers labeled blood both in the
  vascualture and the tissue.</p>

    <img src="Analysis3.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Analysis" width=900>

<p> Now that we are not in 'White Paper' mode we can also change the
  calibration method. On the 'Calibration' tab, change the 'Calibration mode' to 'Reference
  Region'. Now all of the 'Reference tissue' options will become
  available, but leave these as they are: we will accept the default
  option of using the CSF (in the ventricles) for calibration.</p>

   <img src="Calib2.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Calibration" width=900>

  <p>The resulting perfusion images should look very similar to those
  produced using the voxelwise calibration, and the absolute values
  should be similar too. For this, and many datasets, the two methods
  are broadly equivalent. You can check on some of the interim
  calcuations for the calibration by looking in the
  <code>oxasl/calib</code> subdirectory: here you will find the value
  of the estimated equilirbirum mangetization of arterial blood for
  this dataset in <code>M0.txt</code> and the reference tissue mask in
  <code>refmask.nii.gz</code>. It is worth checking that the latter
  does indeed only lie in the venticles when overlaid on an ASL image
  (e.g. the perfusion image or the calibration image), it should be
  conservative, i.e., only select voxels well within the ventricles
  and not on the boundary with white matter.</p>

<h2>Partial Volume Correction</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 6.3)</h3>

  <p>Having dealt with structural image and in the process obtained
  partial volume estimates we are now in a position to do partial
  volume correction. This does more than simply attempt to estimate
  the mean perfusion within the grey matter by the definition of an
  ROI based on the partial voume estimates, but attempts to derive and
  image of gray matter perfusion directly (along with a separate image
  for white matter).</p>

<p>Return to your earlier analysis and now on the 'Analysis' tab
select 'Partial Volume Correction'. Then click 'Run'.</p>

<p>In the results directory you will still find an analysis performed
without partial volume correction in <code>oxasl/native_space</code>
as before. The results of partial volume correction can be found in
<code>oxasl/native_space/pvcorr</code>. This new subdirectory has the
same structure as the non-corrected results, only now
<code>perfusion_calib.nii.gz</code> is an estimate of perfusion only
in gray matter, it has been joined by a new set of images for the
estimation of white matter perfusion, e.g.,
<code>perfusion_wm_calib.nii.gz</code>. It may be more helpful to look at
<code>perfusion_calib_masked.nii.gz</code> (and the equivalent
<code>perfusion_wm_calib_masked.nii.gz</code>) since this has been
masked to include only voxels with more than 10% gray matter (or white
matter), i.e., voxels in which it is reasonable to interpret the gray
matter (white matter) perfusion values.</p>
