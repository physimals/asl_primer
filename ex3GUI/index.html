<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Example 3: Perfusion Analysis using multi-PLD
  pcASL (GUI)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this example is to analyse data that has been
  acquired with multiple post-labeling delays. The analysis is on data
  from the same subject (and the same session) as used in <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a>  and <a href="../ex2GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>. This example
  uses the data first met in Chapter 4 of the primer.</p>

    <p> NOTE that we reccomend you use FSL v6.0.1 (or higher) for these
  exercises.</p>

  <p>For this example you should use the Multi-PLD pcASL data, you
  will also need images from the Single-PLD pcASL data. The multi-PLD pcASL data was acquired using a label duration of 1.4 seconds and PLDs of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
  1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 seconds. </p>

  <pre class="listing">
<a href="../data/index.html" target="_blank">Get the data</a>
</pre>

  <h2>Perfusion Quantification </h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 4.1)</h3>

  <p>Load the GUI (<code>Asl</code> or <code>Asl_gui</code>). On the
  'Input Data' tab, for the 'Input Image' load
  <code>asltc.nii.gz</code>. Unlike the single-PLD data in <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> we need to specify the correct number
  of PLD, which is 6. At this point the 'Number of repeats' should
  correctly read 8. Click 'Update' below the 'Data preview pane'. A
  perfusion-weighted image should appear - this is an average over all
  the PLDs (and will thus look different to <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a>).</p>

   <p>Note the 'Data order preview'. For mutli-PLD ASL it is important
  to get the data order specification right. In this case the default
  options in the GUI are not correct. The PLDs do come as label-control
  pairs, i.e. alternating label then control images. But, the default
  assumption in the GUI is that a full set of the
  6 PLDs has been acquired first, then this has been repeated 8
  subseqeunt times. (This is quite commonly how multi-PLD ASL data is acquired,
  but that might not always be how the data is ordered in the final image
  file) .</p>

  <p>As we noted earlier, in this data all of the measurements at the
  same PLD are grouped together. You need to change the 'Volumes Grouped By'
  option to 'TIs/PLDs' on the 'Input Data' tab. Note that the data order preview changes to reflect the
  different ordering. This is now correct: we have 8 repeats of the first PLD
  followed by 8 repeats of the second, and so on.</p>

  <p>Note that if you were to click 'Update' on the 'Data preview' nothing
  changes, the ordering doesn't affect the (simple) way in which we
  have calucated the PWI. Getting a plausible looking PWI is a good sign that the data
  order is correct, but it is not a guarantee that the PLD ordering is
  correct, so always check carefully. One way to do this, in this
  case, would be to open the data in <code>fsleyes</code> and look at
  the timeseries: the raw intensity of both label and control images
  for one PLD are different to those from another PLD (due to the
  background suprresion). The timeseries for the raw data looks like a
  series of steps, indicating the repeated measurements from each PLD
  are grouped together (groubed by 'repeats').</p>

<list>Once we are happy with the PWI and data order, we can set the
'Acquisition parameters':
<li>Labelling - 'cASL/pcASL' (default).</li>
<li>Bolus duration (s) - 1.4 (shorter than the default).</li>
<li>PLDs (s) - 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.254, 1.5. </li>
<li>Readout - '2D multi-slice' with 'TIme per slice' 45.2.</li>
</list>

<p>Move to the 'Calibration' tab, select 'Enable Calibration' and as
the 'Calibration Image' load the <code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code> image
from the Single-PLD data (it is from the same subject in the same
session so we can use it here too). We have skipped the 'Structure'
tab (to make the analysis quicker), this means if we want 'Calibration
mode' to be 'Reference Region' we need to supply a 'Mask' of the
region of tissue to use. This has been supplied with this data (in fact
it is simply the result of running the analysis from <a href="../ex2GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>). You should select 'Mask' and load
<code>csfmask.nii.gz</code>. Set the 'Sequence TR' to be 4.8, but
leave all of the other options alone.</p>

<p>Move to the 'Distortion Correction' tab. Select 'Apply disotrion
correction'. Load the 'Phase-encode-reveresed calibration image'
  <code>aslcalib_PA.nii.gz</code> from the Single-PLD pcASL data. Set the 'Effective EPI echo
spacing' to 0.00095 and the 'Phase encoding direction' to 'y'.</p>

<p>Finally, move to the 'Analysis' tab. Choose an output directory,
leave all of the other options alone. Click 'Run'.</p>

  <p>The results directory from this analysis should look similar to
  that obtained in  <a href="../ex2GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a>. The main difference is that the
  <code>arrival.nii.gz</code> image is now a genuine estimate of
  ATT; if you examine this image you should find a pattern of values
  consistent with the time it takes for blood to transit between the
  labeling to imaging regions. You might notice that the
  <code>arrival.nii.gz</code> image was present even in the single-PLD
  results, but if you looked at it contained a single value - the one
  set in the Analysis tab - which meant that it
  appeared blank in that case.</p>

  <h2>Arterial/Macrovascular Signal Correction</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Box 4.2)</h3>

  <p>In the analysis above we didn't attempt to model the presence of
  arterial (macrovascular) signal. This is fairly
  reasonable for pcASL in general, since we can only start sampling
  some time after the first arrival of labeled blood-water in the
  imaging region. However, given we are using shorter PLD in our
  multi-PLD sampling to improve the SNR there is a much greater
  likelihood of arterial signal being present. Thus, we might like to
repeat the analysis with this component included</p>

<p>Return to your analysis from before. On the 'Analysis' tab select
'Include macro vascular component'. Click 'Run'.</p>

The results directory should be almost identical to the
  previous run, but now we also gain some new results:
  <code>aCBV.nii.gz</code> and
  <code>aCBV_calib.nii.gz</code>; following the convention for the
  perfusion images, these are the relative and absolute arterial
  (cerebral) blood volumes respectively. If you examine one of these
  and focus on the more inferior slices you should see a pattern of
  higher values that map out the structure of the major arterial
  vasculature, including the Circle of Willis. This finding of an
  arterial contribution in some voxels results in a correction to the
  perfusion image - you may now be able to spot that in the same
  slices where there was some evidence for arterial contamination of
the perfusion image before that has now been removed.</p>

<h2>Partial Volume Correction</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 6.4)</h3>
<p>In the same way that we could do
partial volume correction in <a href="../ex2GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 2</a> for single PLD pcASL, we can do this
for multi-PLD.</p>

<p>Return to your analysis setup. We will require structural
information, so go to the 'Structure' tab. We will use the structural
image from the Single-PLD pcASL data (same subject). Either choose
'Structural data from' 'Run FSL_ANAT on structural image' and load the
'Structural Image' from the Single-PLD pcASL data directory, or use
the output of <code>fsl_anat</code> from a previous run with the
'Structural data from' 'Existing FSL_ANAT output', loading the
<code>T1.anat</code> accordingly. On the 'Analysis' tab, select
'Partial Volume Correction'. Click 'Run'.

<p>The results directory now contains, as a further subdirectory, <code>pvcorr</code>,
within the <code>native_space</code> subdirectory, the partial volume
corrected results: gray matter (<code>perfusion_calib.nii.gz</code>
etc) and white matter perfusion
(<code>perfusion_wm_calib.nii.gz</code> etc)
maps. Alongside these there are also gray and white matter ATT maps
(<code>arrival</code> and <code>arrival_wm</code> respectively). The
estimated maps for the arterial component
(<code>aCBV_calib.nii.gz</code> etc) are still present in the
<code>pvcorr</code> directory. Since this is not tissue specific there
are not separate gray and white matter versions of this parameter.</p>
