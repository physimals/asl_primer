<title>Example 2: Perfusion Analysis using pcASL</title>
</head>

<body>
<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Example 2: Perfusion Analysis using pcASL</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this example is essentailly do a better job of the
  analysis we did in  <a href="../ex1/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> on the same data using the <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BASIL"
  target="dynamic">BASIL</a> tools in FSL. Thus this example
  incorporates various corrections, for motion and distortion, as
  outlined in Chapter 2 of the primer. The example then goes on to
  explore calibration (Chapter 5), partial volume correction (Chapter
  6) and analysis using epochs (Chapter 7).</p>

  <p> NOTE that we reccomend you use FSL v6.0.1 (or higher) for these exercises.</p>

  <p> For this example you should use the Single PLD pcASL dataset
  set. This ASL data was acquired using pcASL labelling
  with a label duration of 1.8 seconds and a post-labelling delay
  (PLD) of 1.8 seconds, following the recommendations of the ASL
  consensus paper. </p>

  <pre class="listing">
<a href="../data/index.html" target="_blank">Get the data</a>
</pre>

  <h2>Perfusion Quantification</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Boxes 1.3, 3.1, 3.2 & 5.1)</h3>

<p>We can proceed to do the full quantification using a single call to
  <code>oxford_asl</code> as we did in Example 1, only now with a few extra options:
</p>

<pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --wp --casl --iaf=tc --tis=3.6 --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 --spatial --mc -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095
  </pre>

<p><list>Note that we have now specified:
<li>That motion correction is to be done: <code>--mc</code>. This is
simply an application of <code>mcflirt</code> to the ASL series, as
  well as realignment of the calibration images to the series
  too.</li>
  <li> That distortion correction is to be done using a blip-reversed
  calibration image, the phase encoding direction being along y
  (anterior-posterior axis) and the effective echo spacing of the
  images: <code>--cblip=aslcalib_PA.nii.gz --pedir=y
  --echospacing=0.00095</code>.</li>
  <li>That automated spatial regularisation (a 'spatial prior') should
  be implmented on the estimated perfusion image: <code>--spatial</code>. This will reduce the
  appearance of noise in the final perfusion image and effect the
  minimum ammount of smoothing appropriate for the data.</li>
</list></p>

<p>For this analysis we still have <code>oxford_asl</code> into 'White
Paper' mode (<code>--wp</code>).Specifically this tells it to use the
  simplest kinetic model that assumes all delivered blood-water has
  the same T1 as that of blood (see Chapter 4 of the ASL primer for
  more information) and that the Arterial Transit Time should be
  treated as 0 seconds.</p>

<p>To view the final result:</p>
<pre class="bash">
fsleyes oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib.nii.gz
  </pre>

<p>The result will be similar to the analysis in <a href="../ex1/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> although the effect of distortion
  correction should be noticeable in the anterior protion of the
  brain. The effects of motion correction are less obvious, this
  data does not have a lot of motion corruption in it.</p>

  <h2>Making use of Structural Images</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Example Boxes 3.4 & 6.1)</h3> 
  <p>Thus far all of the analyses have relied purely on the ASL data
  alone. However, often you will have a (higher resolution) structural
  image in the same subject and would like to use this as well, at the
  very least as part of the proceess to transform the perfusion images into some
  template space.</p>

  <p>We can repeat the analysis above but now providing structural
  information to <code>oxford_asl</code>. The recommended way to do
  this is to take your T1 weighted structural image (which is most
  common) and firstly process using <code>fsl_anat</code>, passing the
  output directly from that tool to <code>oxford_asl</code>:</p>

  <pre class="bash">
  fsl_anat -i T1.nii.gz
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --wp --casl --iaf=tc --tis=3.6 --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095 --fslanat=T1.anat
  </pre>

  <p>This analysis will take longer overall, although the extra time
  is taken up doing registration between ASL and structural
  images. 

  <p>You will now find some new results in the output
  directory:</p>
  <list>
  <li> <code>oxasl/struct_space</code> - this sub-drectory contains results
  transformed into the same space as the structural image. The
 files in here will match those in the <code>native_space</code>
  subdirectry of the earlier analysis, i.e., containing perfusion
images with and without calibration.</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/asl2struct.mat</code> - this is the
  (linear) transformation between ASL and structural space. It can be
  used along with a transofrmation between sturcutral and template
  space to transofrm the ASL data into the template space. It was used
  to creat the results in <code>oxasl/struct_space</code>.</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib_gm_mean.txt</code> -
  this contains the result of calculating the perfusion within a gray
  matter mask, these are in ml/100g/min. The mask was derived from the partial volume estimates
  created by <code>fsl_anat</code> and transformed into ASL space
  followed by thresholding at 70%. This is a helpful check on the
  absolute perfusion values found and it is not aytpical too see
  values in the range 30-50 here. There is also a white matter result
(for which a threshold of 90% was used).</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/gm_mask.nii.gz</code> - this is the gray
  matter mask used in the above calculations. There is also the
  associated white matter mask.</li>
  <li> <code>oxasl/native_space/gm_roi.nii.gz</code> - this is another
  mask that represents areas in which there is some grey matter (at
  least 10% from the partial volume estimates). This can be useful for
  visualisation, but mainly when looking at partial volume corrected
  data.</li>
  </list>

  <h2>Reference Tissue Calibration</h2>
  <h3>(Primer Examples Boxes 5.3 & 5.4)</h3>
  <p>Thus far the calibration to get perfsion in units of ml/100g/min
  has been done using a voxelwise division of the realtive perfusion
  image by the (suitbaly corrected) calibration image - so called
  'voxelwise' calibration. This is in keeping with the recommendations
  of the ASL White Paper for a simple to implement quantitative
  analysis. However, we could also choose to use a reference tissue to
  derive a single value for the equilirbirum mangetizstion of arterial
  blood and use that in the calibnration process:</p>

  <pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --bat=0 --casl --iaf=tc --tis=3.6 --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095 --fslanat=T1.anat
  </pre>

  <p>Notice the change in the command: <code>--wp</code>
  has been replaced by <code>--bat=0</code>. In this run
  <code>oxford_asl</code> is no longer in 'White Paper' mode, but we
  are keeping with the assumption (implicitly) made by the ASL White
  Paper that arterial transit time is zero (for historical reasons <code>oxford_asl</code>
  calls it bat rather than att). The major difference is that
  <oxford_asl> will now by default use the CSF partial volume
  estimates to automatically generate a ventricle mask and calcuate the
  equilirbirum mangetization of arterial blood from this reference
  'tissue' as part of the calibration. Note that we can force which
  calibration process <code>oxford_asl</code> uses with the
  <code>--cmethod</code> option.</p>

  <p>The resulting perfusion images should look very similar to those
  produce using the voxelwise calibration, and the absolute values
  should be similar too. For this, and many datasets, the two methods
  are broadly equivalent. You can check on some of the interim
  calcuations for the calibration by looking in the
  <code>oxasl/calib</code> subdirectory: here you will find the value
  of the estimated equilirbirum mangetization of arterial blood for
  this dataset in <code>M0.txt</code> and the reference tissue mask in
  <code>refmask.nii.gz</code>. It is worth checking that the latter
  does indeed only lie in the venticles when overlaid on an ASL image
  (e.g. the perfusion image or the calibration image), it should be
  conservative, i.e., only select voxels well within the ventricles
  and not on the boundary with white matter.</p>

<h2>Partial Volume Correction</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 6.3)</h3>

  <p>Having dealt with structural image and in the process obtained
  partial volume estimates we are now in a position to do partial
  volume correction. This does more than simply attempt to estimate
  the mean perfusion within the grey matter by the definition of an
  ROI based on the partial voume estimates, but attempts to derive and
  image of gray matter perfusion directly (along with a separate image
  for white matter).</p>
  <p>As long as the structural image is available
  <code>oxford_asl</code> will allow you to do partial volume
  correction by the addition of the <code>--pvcorr</code> option:</p>

  <pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --bat=0 --casl --iaf=tc --tis=3.6 --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --cblip=aslcalib_PA --pedir=y --echospacing=0.00095 --fslanat=T1.anat --pvcorr
  </pre>

<p>In the results directory you will still find an analysis performed
without partial volume correction in <code>oxasl/native_space</code>
as before. The results of partial volume correction can be found in
<code>oxasl/native_space/pvcorr</code>. This new subdirectory has the
sam structure as the non-corrected results, only now
<code>perfusion_calib.nii.gz</code> is an estimate of perfusion only
in gray matter, it has been joined by a new set of images for the
estimation of white matter perfusion, e.g.,
<code>perfusion_wm_calib.nii.gz</code>. It may be more helpful to look at
<code>perfusion_calib_masked.nii.gz</code> (and the equivalent
<code>perfusion_wm_calib_masked.nii.gz</code>) since this has been
masked to include on voxels with more than 10% gray matter (white
matter), i.e., voxels in which it is reasonable to interpret the gray
matter (white matter) perfusion values.</p>

<h2>Analysis in Epochs</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 7.2)</h3>
<p>It is possible to analyse subsets of this ASL data to look for
potential fluctuations in perfusion during the scan. As this was a
resting scan wemight not expect to see large chanages; but, the
principles of analysing 'epochs' of data can be applied in setigns
where gradual or unpredictable perfusion changes might occur</p>

<p>For epoch analysis we have to specifcy the 'length' of the epoch to
use (number of volumes to be extracted for each perfusion image
created) and the overlap between epochs (again the number of
volumes). Here we will use epochs of 10 volumes with an overlap of 5,
giving a total of 5 epochs.

<pre class="bash">
  oxford_asl -i asltc -o oxasl --bat=0 --casl --iaf=tc --tis=3.6 --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 --spatial --mc \
  -c aslcalib --tr 4.8 --fslanat=T1.anat \
  --elen=10 --eol=5
</pre>

<p>As before this will produce a perfusion image using the whole of
the data which is found in the <code>native_space</code>
subdirectory. This will have been joined by a series of
sub_directories, <code>epoch0000</code> ... <code>epoch0004</code>,
that contain the results of analysis of only the label-control images
in each epoch. </p>

<h2> ADVANCED: Distortion correction using TOPUP</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 3.2)</h3>
  <p>In this example we have allowed <code>oxford_asl</code> to do the
  distortion correction, which uses TOPUP internally. You can opt to
  do this for yourself, which may be necessary if your data is not in
  the form <code>oxford_asl</code> expects, e.g., you do not have
  blip-reversed calibration images.</p>

  <p>To do distortion correction using TOPUP on this data you would
  need to do the following:</p>

  <p>Run TOPUP to estimate the distortion.</p>

  <pre class="bash">
fslmerge -t aslcalib_blipped aslcalib aslcalib_PA 
echo "0 1 0 0.06" > topup_params.txt
echo "0 -1 0 0.06" >> topup_params.txt
topup --imain=aslcalib_blipped --datain=topup_params.txt --config=b02b0.cnf --out=topup_results
  </pre>

  <p>Apply the correction to the calibration images.</p>
  
   <pre class="bash">
    applytopup --imain=aslcalib,aslcalib_PA --inindex=1,2
    --datain=topup_params.txt --topup=topup_results --out=aslcalib_corr --method=jac
  </pre>

  <p>Apply the correction to the ASL series.</p>

   <pre class="bash">
    applytopup --imain=asltc --datain=topup_params.txt
    --inindex=1 --topup=topup_results --out=asltc_corr --method=jac
</pre>

<p>We can do a quick check to see if this has worked by looking at the
PWI, which we can generate using <code>asl_file</code>:</p>

<pre class="bash">
asl_file --data=id${id}_asltc_corr --ntis=1 --iaf=tc --diff --out=asldiffdata_corr --mean=asldiffdata_corr_mean
</pre>

<p>Compare this to the uncorrected case:</p>

<pre class="bash">
asl_file --data=asltc --ntis=1 --iaf=tc --diff --out=asldiffdata --mean=asldiffdata_mean
fsleyes asldiffdata_mean asldiffdata_corr_mean
</pre>

<p>Ideally we would like to apply motion correction together with
distortion correction (having derived suitable estimates of their
separate effects first). A pragmatic compromise would be to do the
motion correction first and then the disotortion correction.</p>

<h2>ADVANCED: Partial Volume Correction using Linear Regression</h2>
<h3>(Primer Example Box 6.2)</h3>

<p>The partial volume correction in <code>oxford_asl</code> is based
on a method that exploits the Bayesian inference methods built into
BASIL. However, you can opt to use the alternative Linear Regression
approach should you wish. To do this you have to do the correction in
a first step, using <code>asl_file</code>, prior to quantification
using <code>oxford_asl</code>:</p>

<pre class="bash">
# get partial volume estimates into the ASL space
convert_xfm -omat struct2asl.mat -inverse oxasl/native_space/asl2struct.mat
applywarp --ref=asltc --in=T1.anat/T1_fast_pve_1 --out=pvgminasl --premat=struct2asl.mat --super --interp=spline --superlevel=4

# do linear regression on the ASL difference data
asl_file --data=asltc --ntis=1 --iaf=tc --diff --out=asldiffdata
asl_file --data=asldiffdata --ntis=1 --iaf=diff --mask=oxasl/native_space/mask \
--pvgm=pvgminasl --pvwm=pvwminasl --kernel=5 --out=asldiff_LR

# do the quantification on the LR corrected difference data
    oxford_asl -i asldiff_LR -o oxasl_LR --spatial --bat=0 --iaf=diff --casl --tis=3.6 --bolus=1.8 --slicedt=0.0452 \
-c aslcalib --csf=oxasl/calib/refmask --cmethod=single
   fslmaths oxasl_LR/native_space/perfusion_calib -mas oxasl/native_space/gm_mask LR_perfusion_calib_masked
</pre>

<p>Note that we have made use of the results from a previous run of
oxford_asl on the non-corrected data for things like the brain mask,
transformation between ASL and structural space and the grey matter
mask. This routine only computes gray matter perfusion, a similar
approach could be taken for white matter.</p>
